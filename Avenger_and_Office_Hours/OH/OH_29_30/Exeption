1- CHECKED VS UNCHECKED EXCEPTIONS

    CHECKED EXCEPTIONS : Unwanted event

         - It occurs in Compiler Time
         - We MUST handle it
         - Easy To Catch
         - Solutions
               - Try Catch
               - Throws

    UNCHECKED EXCEPTIONS : Unexpected event

         -  It occurs in Runtime (All unchecked exceptions are Runtime Exception)
         -  Code will compile even if we handle or NOT
         -  not easy to catch
         -  Solutions
                - TRY CATCH


2-TRY CATCH

    - It can be used for UNCHECKED and CHECKED
    - It will handle exception permanently

    MULTIPLE TRY CATCH
    - TRY block will be capable of throw one or more exception
    - if we dont type of exception we need to use it

    RULE : PARENT exception type can not be placed before CHILD

3-THROWS

  - used for ONLY CHECKED EXCEPTIONS
  - it informs the compiler that methods will throw one or more exceptions

  RULE : When you declare (THROW) a CHECKED EXCEPTIONS , whoever calls this method responsible to handle it
         Throws
         Try Catch

4-FINALLY

    - Why we need finally ?
    - If we want to some code to be always executed we need to use finally block

    - Runs no matter what

5-THROW
    - if you want to throw an exception manually you can use --> throw new ExceptionClass();
           - Java Exceptions (NullPointer, IndexOutOFBounds etc )
           - Custom Exceptions

6- CUSTOM EXCEPTIONS

    -     We can create exception by extending parent Exception classes

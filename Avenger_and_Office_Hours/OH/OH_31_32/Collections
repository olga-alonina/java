Collection framework: consists of multiple interfaces, each interface is implemented by classes with different different way

	Collection (I): Dynamic Sized
					supports non-primitives ONLY
                    extended by List, Set, Queue


			List (I): has index numbers, accept duplicates ,Insertion Order preserved

				ArrayList (C): Array Based Class, internally uses array
								retrieving the data is faster ( get() )

				LinkedList (C): each objects are doublly linked
								adding & removing are faster (add() & remove())

				Vector (C): is synchronized ==> thread-safe
				        Synchronized:
				                multiple threads are being executed one thread at time
                                        advantage: thread-safe
                                        disadvantage: slower

                Stack (C): is synchronized ==> thread-safe. LIFO (last in first out)
                        pop():  removes the last inserted object from the stack and returns it
                        peek(): returns last element without removing it
                        push(): add element into stack


			Set (I): does not have index, does not accept duplicates,Insertion Order not preserved

				HashSet (C): order is random. accepts null key. faster

				LinkedHashSet (C): keeps the insertion order as it is. accepts null key

				TreeSet (C): keeps the sorted(ascending) order. does not accept null key (nullPointerException will be given)



			Queue (I): does not have index, accept duplicates. FIFO (first in first out)

				PriorityQueue (C): order is random (similar asc order ). does not have index number,does not accept  nulls

				ArrayDequeue (C): keeps the same insertion order. does not have index number,accept nulls

				LinkedList (C): keeps the same insertion order, has index number




Iterable: Root Interface of Collection
		Classes that are implementing iterable interface gains the ability to use iterator interface

		Iterator (I):
			1. allows us to get access to each object
			2. allows us to remove any objects from collection type


			methods:
				hasNext(): checks if there is object. returns boolean

				next():
						if hasNext() is true ==> can get access to the object
						if hasNext() is false==> no object can be accessed

				remove(): removes the object
